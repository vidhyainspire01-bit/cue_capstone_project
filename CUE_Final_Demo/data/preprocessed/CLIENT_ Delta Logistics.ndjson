CUE Call Transcripts — Delta Logistics (August 2025) Folder: We saw your ticket T-0825-005 about shipment-tracking updates arriving several hours late. CUE Call Transcripts — Delta Logistics (August 2025) Folder: Can you walk us through what you’re seeing? CUE Call Transcripts — Delta Logistics (August 2025) Folder: Miguel (Customer): Sure — status updates on our dashboard lag three to four hours behind actual shipments.

CUE Call Transcripts — Delta Logistics (August 2025) Folder: Noah (Engineer): That matches our logs.
