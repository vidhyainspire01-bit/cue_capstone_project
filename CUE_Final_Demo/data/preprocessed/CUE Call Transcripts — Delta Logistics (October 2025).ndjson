We wanted to confirm everything stayed stable through September’s rollout. Miguel (Customer): Yes — no delays since mid-September. Response times hover around 700 milliseconds, which is excellent. Noah (Engineer): Great to hear. We’ve moved your monitoring profile to our “steady-state” queue. You’ll still get daily latency summaries automatically. Priya: Perfect. Any other issues from the regional teams? Miguel: None so far. They’ve been pleasantly surprised by how fast dashboards refresh. Priya: Fantastic. We’ll treat the integration as fully resolved and close out T-1025-002 today. Miguel: Agreed — please send us a closure summary for our internal report. 📞 C-1025-02 — Billing Consolidation & Renewal Prep Date: 2025-10-25 Theme: Finance Simplification / Renewal Planning Participants: Priya Desai (CSM), Marcus Reed (Account Manager), Elena Patel (Finance Controller – Delta Logistics), Miguel Shah (VP Operations) Transcript Marcus (Account Manager): Elena, thanks for joining. I understand you’d like to consolidate regional invoices? Elena (Customer): Yes — we currently receive three separate SmartOnboard invoices. It’d be easier to manage one consolidated PDF each month. Priya (CSM): That’s absolutely doable. We’ll bundle the regional accounts under the main Delta Ops tenant for November’s billing cycle. Miguel (Customer): Great. From an operations standpoint, performance is excellent. We’re ready to renew on schedule. Marcus: Perfect. We’ll send over the renewal quote and updated billing structure next week. Elena: Appreciate the quick turnaround. Priya: Thanks everyone — it’s great closing the quarter on such a positive note.", "length_words": 282, "source_path": "D:\\CUE_\\Data sets\\Client call transcripts\\Delta Logistics\\October\\CUE Call Transcripts — Delta Logistics (October 2025).docx"}
