Date: I wanted to check in after your team’s onboarding completion last month — how are things looking? Date: Linda (Customer): Much better overall. Date: The import and automations are working fine. Date: But we’re still not clear on the “Usage vs. Adoption” widgets in the dashboard. Date: They look similar but show different numbers. Date: Thomas (PM): Great point. Date: “Usage” measures total active sessions, while “Adoption” reflects engagement with key workflows. Date: We’ll relabel and add tooltips in the next update. Date: Ethan (Customer): That would help. Date: Our internal reports use different terminology, so the mismatch confuses our managers. Date: Rachel: Totally understandable. Date: Once the relabel goes live, I’ll schedule a short analytics walkthrough. Date: Linda: Appreciate it — otherwise, the system’s stable and our analysts are happy. Date: Rachel: That’s great progress compared to last month. Date: 📞 C-0925-02 — Adoption Metrics & Next Steps Date: 2025-09-18 Theme: Feature Adoption / Progress Review Participants: Rachel Kim (CSM), Nia Torres (Trainer), Ethan Cole (Systems Analyst), Jamie Park (Data Analyst) Transcript Rachel (CSM): Hi team — wanted to review your adoption data. Date: Since the training in August, your usage has climbed about 18%. Date: That’s a solid improvement. Date: Ethan (Customer): Yes, the teams have started building more automation rules. Date: The new workflows are saving us manual time. Date: Nia (Trainer): Excellent. Date: Any blockers left? Date: Jamie (Customer): Not major ones — we’d just like more visibility into which departments are most active. Date: Rachel: That’s coming in the next analytics release. Date: It’ll include department-level filtering. Date: Ethan: Great — we’ll keep scaling adoption across our divisions. Date: Nia: Awesome. Date: Keep me posted if you want a deeper automation session later this quarter. Date: Rachel: Perfect. Date: Thanks everyone — great to see the upward trend.", "length_words": 335, "source_path": "D:\\CUE_\\Data sets\\Client call transcripts\\Acme Tech\\September\\September call transcripts.docx"}
