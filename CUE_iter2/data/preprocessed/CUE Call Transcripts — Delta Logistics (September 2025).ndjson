How’s latency looking this week? Miguel (Customer): Considerably better — we’re averaging about 1.2 seconds now. That’s down roughly 40% from last month. Lila (Customer): The only concern is brief spikes around 10 PM UTC during high-load days. Noah (Engineer): We noticed those too. It’s related to batch concurrency, not the webhook queue. We’re tuning that configuration tonight. Priya: Perfect. Once that’s done, we’ll monitor again for five days. Miguel: Sounds good. If it holds steady, we can close out ticket T-0925-002 next week. Priya: Great — I’ll share the updated performance graph Monday morning. 📞 C-0925-02 — Operational Confidence Call Date: 2025-09-19 Theme: System Stability / Rollout Readiness Participants: Priya Desai (CSM), Miguel Shah (VP Operations), Lila Ross (Ops Analyst) Transcript Priya (CSM): Miguel, just checking in after the latest patch. How’s performance this week? Miguel (Customer): Smooth. Average latency is around 900 ms, and no reports of missed updates. Lila (Customer): We’re comfortable extending SmartOnboard to two new regions next week. Priya: That’s great news. We’ll help you set up the monitoring dashboards per region. Miguel: Perfect. The improvement has been significant. We’ll keep our existing alert thresholds but expect fewer notifications now. Priya: Excellent — I’ll mark your account as “stable with active rollout.”", "length_words": 251, "source_path": "D:\\CUE_\\Data sets\\Client call transcripts\\Delta Logistics\\September\\CUE Call Transcripts — Delta Logistics (September 2025).docx"}
